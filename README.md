# Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio, designed and developed using React.js and GSAP.

My portfolio showcases my skills and projects. I've also integrated the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library to add animations and transitions.

Everything is dockerized, just install Docker on you host machine then run:

```
docker compose up --build
```

To work locally, you should install the NPM dependencies by running:

```
npm i
```

Please note that everytime you install a new NPM package, you should rerun you docker compose command.
